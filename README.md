# Pet Project Ideas
Repo where I keep project ideas 

1. Slackbot for "bad" words - everytime someone uses a bad word on slack, the bot says that he or she should put a penny in a coin jar :) As soon as jar is full the "winner" is announced 

2. Automated invitation page to Women who code slack - create a page where people who want to join can invite themselves 

3. A website to generate some interview questions for algorithms meetup. It should have different filters on difficulty, topic, time to solve and some timer.
